- Log into your dashboard

### Step 3: Get API Key
- Go to your dashboard
- Look for "API Keys" section
- Click "Create New API Key" 
- Copy the generated API key

### Step 4: Add to Environment
- Open `web/.env.local` file
- Replace the empty `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=` with:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`

## 2. üîó WalletConnect Project ID

### Step 1: Go to WalletConnect

## 3. ‚úÖ Final Steps

### Restart Development Server
After adding the API keys:
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

### Test the Application
1. Connect your wallet (make sure it's on Filecoin Calibration)
2. Try creating a time capsule
3. The error should be gone!

## üìù Example .env.local File

```bash
# Your file should look like this (with real values):
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz
NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID=2f05a7cde11b9f9225a9b4c7f1d3e8f6

# These are already set correctly:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xf939f81b62a57157C6fA441bEb64B2E684382991
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME=Filecoin Calibration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=314159
```

## üÜò Need Help?

### Common Issues:

2. **Invalid API key**: Double-check you copied the full key from Lighthouse
3. **WalletConnect issues**: Verify your Project ID is correct

### Free Alternatives:
- **Lighthouse**: Free tier includes 100MB storage

Both services are free to use for development and small projects!
